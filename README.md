# Phase2MSA2016
This is my 2nd repo for the xamarin app project for the MSA Phase 2 assessment, where I need to make an app for a restaurant (mock), using databases (Easy Tables with SQL) and REST APIs. It is all published on Azure and it will work for both iOS and Android as it uses Xamarin Forms. It will use relevant APIs to solve the problem. I made a new repo because.. the first one had some major errors and stuff but I want to keep that repo for evidence. 

THE PROJECT NAME IS CALLED MOODIFY BECAUSE I HAD PROBLEMS WITH MY ORIGINAL PROJECT FOLDER WHICH DID NOT ALLOW ME TO ACCESS AZURE SERVICES. BUT THIS IS THE REPO FOR THE FABRIKAM FOOD APP PHASE 2
